This food ordering system is my first ever web app development project that includes both front end and back end development. This project was developed by three members. I handled the web back end and analysis of the overall system.

In brief, the web app is served using XAMPP with MySQL as the server database. The web app main purpose is to manage the dining table availability, customer orders, and payment. There are five main modules in the app, namely:

  1. Dining Module - for managing seat and takeaways
  2. Ordering Module - for ordering from menu
  3. Order Management Module - for updating order status
  4. Payment Module - for performing payment transactions
  5. Menu Management Module - for updating food Menu


# 1. Dining Module
![Table Status Available](images/projects/food/table-status.png)

This is the first page that the customer will see when using this application. This module is meant to be shown at the kiosk of the restaurant. The customer can use this page to check for availability of table based on the number of guest that they are bringing. If there is no table available, the system will suggest takeaways. When takeaways is selected, the customer will be directed to the ordering module. On the other hand, if there are tables available, the system will reserve the table after showing the available table number to the customer, and the customer can proceed to the table for the ordering module.

# 2. Ordering Module
![Menu Shown](images/projects/food/ordering-menu.png)

This screen is shown on the device by the table. During the duration of the ordering, the customer can select the desired meal from the menu. The menu is grouped by category. Upon finishing ordering, the order status will be shown on the screen.

# 3. Order Management module
![List of Customer Orders](images/projects/food/order-list.png)

On the staff side, this screen will show the list of customers' orders. The staff can update the status of the ordered meals whether the staffs are preparing or serving the orders.

# 4. Payment module
![Transaction is Complete](images/projects/food/payment.png)

At the end of the customer's dining activity, the staff can view their order summary based on the table number of the customer. The mode of payment includes cash and cashless. Finally, the receipt will be printed out for the customer and the restaurant.

# 5. Menu Management module
![Menu Management](images/projects/food/menu-management.png)

This menu management module is for the restaurant to update their menu. The basic operations includes adding menu, editing menu, and removing menu. Upon adding the menu, the restaurant must include at least the name and the price of the food while the photo and the description of the food are optional

Web development is a steadily growing job due to its cross-platform property. This has taught me a lot of simple web development framework and motivated me to learn more for a better web development skill.
