## My Data Science + Web App Portfolio
---

This portfolio web page is scripted using Bootstrap framework and jQuery library. I am also using this as a showcase to my web developing skills. As for now, the interface is simple with no animation plus some JavaScript logic for latency hiding by dynamically adding contents after fetching the content from the server. Before I discuss on how did I do this, let's go through on the features on my website.

## 1. Header

In the header, I show my name and my bachelor degree name. I also put in the title _Fresh Graduate_ for recruiter to know my level of working experience. Next to that, there are two pill links that redirect to my LinkedIn profile and my GitHub profile respectively. There is a list of technical skills shown below it. Finally, the navigation bar navigates to the highlighted projects below, to my resume in PDF file, and to my blog posts.

## 2. Highlights

In the highlighted projects, I put in at most three projects in both category: Machine Learning, and Web App category. I show the brief description on each project and their thumbnail on the left.

## 3. Query App (Under development)

There is a tiny section on the top of the page showing _query my data here_. This is an intended mini-app that you can send in pseudo-SQL query and the app will display the corresponding result. I add this as a gimmick to my basic proficiency in most SQL databases. However, this is still under development, and I hope I can implement this is the simplest way possible for initial release.

## 4. Blog posts

You can navigate to the blog page in two ways: from the navbar in the header, or the project links in the highlight sections. The main page will show all projects that I have included in the description files. When clicking on the project link, the project description will be displayed, just this in this page that you are watching now. The project list is formatted in JSON while the project description is formatted in Markdown for easy formatting.
