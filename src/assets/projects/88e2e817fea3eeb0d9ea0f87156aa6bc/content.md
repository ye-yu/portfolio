It seems like at the moment, Readsy (that is using Spritz API) has the higher similarity with FastRead and a wider range of feature although lacking of by-character support.
This does not support languages like Mandarin in their reading application unlike FastRead.
Plus, FastRead will remain uncommercialised and open source.
